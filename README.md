## About corpus

The spoken Besleney corpus includes texts of a wide variety of genres recorded in the village of Ulyap in the Republic of Adygea. The Besleney dialect is the western-most dialect of the Kabardian (East Circassian) language, and it contains a significant number of differences from the literary standard. The Ulyap subdialect of the Besleney dialect also actively interacts with the closely related West Circassian language.

The texts were recorded and glossed during expeditions by the Russian State University of the Humanities (RSUH) and Higher School of Economics (HSE University) in 2011-2013, and Irina Bagirokova (HSE University) also took part in later glossing work on the corpora. Morphological analysis was carried out by expedition participants under the supervision of Peter Arkadiev (Institute for Slavic Studies RAS / RSUH) with the additional participation of Yury Lander (HSE University). Technical work on the corpus was completed by Anna Sorokina and Elena Sokur (HSE university) with support from the Linguistic Convergence Laboratory at HSE University in 2020. The corpus was created within the framework of the HSE University Basic Research Program and funded by the Russian Academic Excellence Project '5-100'.
